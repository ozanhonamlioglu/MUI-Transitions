# What Is It?

This project contains bunch of animated mui components. I try to make it easy to copy into one of your project instead of a big npm library.  
The animated components are mostly consist of modified mui components with styled function, so this approach keep the components running on high performance.

# Who Is It For

I tried to make this components available to everyone who uses mui in their frontend project. The components are not tied to React, because I create them with styled function. So even if you use different frameworks, there is a chance that you can still benefit.

# Can I Modify Your Components?

Absolutely yes, but you have to refer the base component API section at the mui library.  
Some of the advanced component's dimensions are not flexible, which means they are static. So this is all up to you whether modify or not.

# How Can I Modify Then?

Well, the way I follow is css modification so any of mui component's API section is the best place for you too.
